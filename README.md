# p4python-package
Simple script to build p4python (with p4api). Official Perforce instruction is not so accurate, and Perforce has not officially prebuilt wheels of p4python.
So I created simple scripts to automate p4python builds.

### Building
You can just download prebuilt wheels or build them:

* `build-py36` - to build p4python wheel for python3.6
* `build-py37` - to build p4python wheel for python3.7

### Dependencies
* `docker`
